of GSAP as the Swiss Army Knife of animation...but better. It animates anything JavaScript can touch (CSS properties, canvas library objects, SVG, generic objects, whatever) and it solves lots of browser inconsistencies, all with blazing speed (up to 20x faster than jQuery). See http://greensock.com/why-gsap/ for details. Other libraries like jQuery, Velocity, Transit, and Zepto only tween CSS properties. Plus, their sequencing abilities and runtime controls pale by comparison. Simply put, GSAP is the most flexible high-performance animation library on the planet. And unlike monolithic frameworks like Famo.us or Angular that dictate how you structure your apps, GSAP simply owns the animation layer; sprinkle it wherever you want. GSAP stands for the GreenSock Animation Platform. There's a jQuery plugin that hijacks the native jQuery.animate() method so that animations perform much better and additional properties can be tweened, like colors, transforms (2D and 3D), boxShadow, borderRadius, clip, and lots more. GSAP has no dependencies on jQuery or other libraries. See http://greensock.com/gsap/ for details.","homepage":"https://github.com/greensock/GreenSock-JS","versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.12.0","1.13.2","1.10.0","1.15.1","1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.4","1.11.8","1.10.3","1.11.0","1.12.1","1.9.1","1.16.1","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.16.0","1.15.0","1.17.0","1.11.5","1.9.2","1.9.5","1.9.6","1.9.7","1.9.8","1.10.1","1.8.0","1.14.0","1.9.3","1.11.1","1.9.0","1.8.4","1.11.2","1.8.2","1.18.0","1.8.3","1.11.6","1.11.7","1.11.3","1.8.1"]},{"name":"ng-joyride","description":"","homepage":"https://github.com/abhikmitra/ng-joyride","versions":["0.1.11","0.1.9","0.1.8","0.1.3","0.1.18","0.1.14","0.1.15","0.1.5","0.1.19","0.1.7","0.1.20","0.1.13","0.1.12","0.1.16","0.1.4","0.1.17","0.1.2","0.1.6","0.1.10","0.1.1"]},{"name":"evol.colorpicker","description":"jQuery

of GSAP as the Swiss Army Knife of animation...but better. It animates anything JavaScript can touch (CSS properties, canvas library objects, SVG, generic objects, whatever) and it solves lots of browser inconsistencies, all with blazing speed (up to 20x faster than jQuery). See http://greensock.com/why-gsap/ for details. Other libraries like jQuery, Velocity, Transit, and Zepto only tween CSS properties. Plus, their sequencing abilities and runtime controls pale by comparison. Simply put, GSAP is the most flexible high-performance animation library on the planet. And unlike monolithic frameworks like Famo.us or Angular that dictate how you structure your apps, GSAP simply owns the animation layer; sprinkle it wherever you want. GSAP stands for the GreenSock Animation Platform. There's a jQuery plugin that hijacks the native jQuery.animate() method so that animations perform much better and additional properties can be tweened, like colors, transforms (2D and 3D), boxShadow, borderRadius, clip, and lots more. GSAP has no dependencies on jQuery or other libraries. See http://greensock.com/gsap/ for details.","homepage":"https://github.com/greensock/GreenSock-JS","versions":["1.11.4","1.8.4","1.15.1","1.15.0","1.16.0","1.14.0","1.12.0","1.13.1","1.11.3","1.10.2","1.9.5","1.9.6","1.9.7","1.9.0","1.9.3","1.16.1","1.18.2","1.11.0","1.17.0","1.10.1","1.9.2","1.13.2","1.11.7","1.10.3","1.9.8","1.8.1","1.18.1","1.11.5","1.11.2","1.8.2","1.11.8","1.18.0","1.11.6","1.10.0","1.8.3","1.12.1","1.11.1","1.14.1","1.13.0","1.14.2","1.8.0","1.9.1","1.9.4"]},{"name":"twitter","description":"The

The mask shows the general format and gives the user an idea about how they should input the data that your form is requesting of them. A common example of this, is wanting a date to be inputted in a specific format, such as in a month, day, and year order. The common way to portray this to the user is to add some text near the text input that tells or shows the format e.g., MM/DD/YYYY or 04/23/1994. That's good and all, but a text mask can help the user out a little more. The text mask takes your format and throws it directly inside the text field and allows the user to type over the mask as they enter in the data. Examples are probably the better way to get the point across so check out some examples further below.","homepage":"http://www.angelwatt.com/","versions":["1.3.0"]},{"name":"zoom.js","description":"","homepage":"https://github.com/fat/zoom.js","versions":["0.0.1"]},{"name":"require_once","description":"An
